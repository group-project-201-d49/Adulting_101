# Adulting 101
A personalized, game-based learning and development app that motivates users to gain basic adult-level skills.

## Project title
Adulting 101 - a one stop shop for your basic adulthood needs

## Motivation
Our concept and idea was centered around the fact that a lot of young adults grew up in a school system that had defunded Home Economics. So, we have a generation who lack skills like: how to sew on a button, how to change a flat tire, etc, and who need to know those things on an immediate basis. Adulting 101 was pitched as a one-stop-shop for quick and easy to follow articles and how-to videos that would be vetted and curated based on need. So the content can be consumed in a very short amount of time, and then implemented in day to day life. The interface is created to be fun and accessible, with easy-to-navigate links and buttons.

## How to use?
Users navigate to our easy-to-use landing page and enter credentials to track their own "adulting" status. Users may browse through our multiple topic points, including Finance, Social, and Cooking to find the individual skills related to the topic listed. Users can check off skills they've gained and click links for skills that need to be built in order to review articles or videos on skills needed. Users can then return to the app to check off skill items that they feel most confident in. Users watch their status grow as they complete skills on each topic.
